# **Chapter 2: Sensors and Perception Systems**

## **The Role of Sensors in Robotics**
Sensors serve as the sensory organs of humanoid robots, enabling them to gather information about their surroundings.  
Without sensors, robots would operate blindly, unable to respond to environmental changes.  

Modern humanoid systems integrate multiple sensor types to create **comprehensive situational awareness**, similar to how humans use:  
- Sight  
- Touch  
- Hearing  
- Balance  

…simultaneously.

## **Vision Systems and Cameras**
Computer vision provides robots with visual perception through:  
- **RGB cameras** – capture color images for object recognition and scene understanding  
- **Depth cameras** (e.g., Intel RealSense) – measure distances to objects using infrared patterns, enabling 3D mapping  
- **Stereo camera pairs** – provide depth perception  

**Example:** A humanoid robot uses depth cameras to detect stairs and adjust its gait accordingly.

## **Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs)**
IMUs combine:  
- Accelerometers  
- Gyroscopes  
- Magnetometers  

…to track a robot's **orientation, velocity, and acceleration**.  

- Critical for maintaining balance during walking  
- Respond to uneven terrain by triggering immediate adjustments  
- Update at high frequencies (100–1000 Hz) for rapid response

## **Force and Tactile Sensors**
- **Force-torque sensors** in joints and feet measure contact forces during interactions  
- Enable **gentle object manipulation** and safe human-robot collaboration  
- **Tactile sensor arrays** on hands detect texture and pressure, allowing robots to grasp fragile objects (e.g., eggs)  

This capability is essential for **household and caregiving tasks**.

## **Sensor Fusion Techniques**
Robots combine data from multiple sensors using **sensor fusion algorithms**:  
- **Kalman filters**  
- **Particle filters**  

These merge noisy readings into accurate state estimates.  

**Example:** Combining IMU data with vision systems produces more reliable position estimates than either sensor alone, increasing system robustness.

## **Practical Example: Obstacle Detection**
Consider a humanoid robot navigating a cluttered room:  
1. Depth cameras create a 3D point cloud of the environment, identifying furniture and walls  
2. Ultrasonic sensors detect transparent obstacles like glass doors  

The robot's navigation system processes both inputs to plan a **collision-free path**, demonstrating effective sensor integration.
