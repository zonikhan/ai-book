Chapter 6: Computer Vision and Scene Understanding
Importance of Vision in Robotics
Computer vision provides robots with rich environmental information, enabling tasks from:

Navigation
Manipulation
While humans effortlessly interpret visual scenes, robots require sophisticated algorithms to extract meaning from pixel arrays.

Modern vision systems achieve near-human performance in many domains thanks to advances in deep learning.

Object Detection and Recognition
Object detection algorithms identify and locate objects within images:

YOLO (You Only Look Once)
R-CNN families
These networks output bounding boxes and class labels for detected objects.

Example: A service robot uses object detection to locate cups, plates, and utensils on a table before attempting to clear them.

Semantic Segmentation
Segmentation assigns class labels to every pixel, enabling detailed scene understanding.

Helps robots distinguish between floors, walls, furniture, and people at pixel precision
Architectures: FCN (Fully Convolutional Networks), U-Net
Example: A cleaning robot uses segmentation to identify floor areas requiring attention while avoiding carpets and obstacles.

Depth Estimation Techniques
Depth estimation creates 3D understanding from 2D images:

Stereo vision: Compares images from two cameras (like human binocular vision)
Monocular depth estimation: Single camera with neural networks trained to infer depth from cues such as perspective and occlusion
Accurate depth information is essential for obstacle avoidance and grasp planning.

SLAM Technology
Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) enables robots to:

Build environment maps

Track their position within those maps

Visual SLAM: Uses camera images as primary input, extracting and tracking features across frames

Popular implementations: ORB-SLAM, LSD-SLAM

Example: A humanoid robot exploring an unknown building uses SLAM to create a floor plan while knowing its current location.

Practical Exercise: Vision Pipeline
Students implement a complete vision pipeline:

Capture images from a webcam
Apply object detection to identify items
Estimate distances using depth information
Command a simulated robot arm to reach detected objects
This exercise integrates multiple vision techniques into a functional system, demonstrating how components work together in real applications.
