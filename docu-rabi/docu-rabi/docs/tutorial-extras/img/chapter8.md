# **Chapter 8: Balance and Locomotion**

## **The Challenge of Bipedal Walking**
Bipedal locomotion presents **unique stability challenges** compared to wheeled or quadrupedal robots.  

- Humanoid robots must maintain balance on **small foot contact areas**  
- Manage their bodies as **inverted pendulums**  
- Walking involves **controlled falling and recovery**, requiring:  
  - Sophisticated control strategies  
  - Rapid sensory feedback

---

## **Zero Moment Point Theory**
- **Zero Moment Point (ZMP):** Where ground reaction forces sum to zero horizontal moment  
- Maintaining ZMP within the **support polygon** (foot contact area) ensures dynamic stability  
- ZMP-based walking generates trajectories that keep ZMP inside safe margins  

**Example:** Honda's ASIMO achieved reliable flat-ground walking using careful ZMP control.

## **Inverted Pendulum Models**
- **Linear Inverted Pendulum Model (LIPM):** Simplifies bipedal dynamics for control  
  - Assumes robot's center of mass moves as an inverted pendulum above a constant-height point  
- Enables **real-time trajectory generation** for walking  
- More complex models incorporate **ankle and hip strategies** for disturbance rejection

---

## **Gait Generation Methods**
Gait generation produces **foot placement patterns** and **body trajectories**:  
- **Preview control:** Predicts future ZMP positions to adjust current steps  
- **Model Predictive Control (MPC):** Optimizes multi-step horizons considering constraints  

**Example:** A robot walking upstairs uses MPC to plan foot placements that maintain stability while ascending.

## **Push Recovery Strategies**
Robots must recover from **unexpected disturbances**:  
- **Ankle strategies:** Small corrections via ankle torques  
- **Stepping strategies:** Take recovery steps to regain balance  
- **Hip strategies:** Rapid body weight shifts  

Advanced controllers **blend strategies** based on disturbance magnitude.  
**Example:** Atlas robot videos demonstrate effective push recovery in action.

## **Practical Simulation**
Simulation environments allow students to experiment with **bipedal walking controllers**:  
- Adjust **step length, frequency, ZMP margins**  
- Observe effects on stability  
- Safely explore controller limits without risking hardware  

This hands-on experience builds **intuition about walking dynamics** and control trade-offs.
