# **Chapter 7: Motion Planning and Navigation**

---

## **Motion Planning Fundamentals**
Motion planning computes **collision-free paths** from current to goal configurations.  

- High-dimensional spaces with complex obstacles make this **computationally challenging**  
- Humanoid robots with **30+ degrees of freedom** require efficient planning algorithms  
- Real-time operation in dynamic environments is essential

---

## **Configuration Space Concept**
- **Configuration space (C-space):** Represents all possible robot states as points in multi-dimensional space  
- Obstacles in physical space map to **forbidden regions** in C-space  
- Planning in C-space treats the robot as a **point**, simplifying collision checking  

Understanding C-space is **fundamental to grasping planning algorithms**.

## **Sampling-Based Planning: RRT**
- **Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT):** Build tree structures by randomly sampling configurations and connecting feasible ones  
- **Advantages:** Quickly explores large spaces, handles high-dimensional problems  
- **RRT*** improves paths after initial discovery  

**Example:** Humanoid robots plan full-body motions, like crawling through confined spaces.

## **Graph-Based Planning: A***
- **A*** search finds **optimal paths on graphs** using heuristics  
- Grid-based representations discretize environments into cells; edges connect adjacent cells  
- Guarantees shortest paths if **admissible heuristics** are used  

**Use case:** 2D navigation on flat surfaces, such as robot movement across floors.

## **Dynamic Obstacle Avoidance**
- Real environments contain **moving obstacles**, requiring dynamic replanning  
- **Dynamic Window Approach (DWA):** Evaluates velocity commands over short horizons to avoid collisions  
- Local planners like DWA run at **10+ Hz** to react quickly, complementing slower global planners

## **Real-World Application: Warehouse Navigation**
1. **Global planning:** A* plans initial path through warehouse aisles to target shelf  
2. **Local replanning:** Sensors detect a forklift; local planner adjusts velocity to avoid collision  
3. Robot resumes following global path  

This **two-level planning architecture** balances computational efficiency with reactive safety.
