Prompt
    Project: AI/Spec-Driven Book Creation: Write a book using Docusaurus and deploy it to GitHub Pages, utilizing Spec-Kit Plus and Claude Code
Core principles:

Spec-driven development: All content and structure must adhere to predefined specifications generated via Spec-Kit Plus
AI-assisted efficiency: Leverage Claude Code for code generation and content drafting while ensuring human oversight for quality
Open-source accessibility: Use Docusaurus for static site generation to create a readable, navigable book format hosted on GitHub Pages
Iterative refinement: Build the book through incremental specs, reviews, and deployments
Key standards:
Content organization: Follow Docusaurus markdown structure with clear hierarchy (chapters, sections, sidebars)
Code quality: All generated code (via Claude Code) must be linted, tested, and version-controlled in Git
Documentation: Every spec from Spec-Kit Plus must be documented and traceable in the repository
Deployment: Automated CI/CD via GitHub Actions for GitHub Pages
Accessibility: Ensure book content meets WCAG 2.1 standards (e.g., alt text for images, semantic headings)
Constraints:
Tools: Exclusively use Spec-Kit Plus for spec generation, Claude Code for AI assistance, Docusaurus for site building, and GitHub for hosting
Book length: Minimum 10 chapters or equivalent sections, with at least 20,000 words
Version control: All changes committed to Git with descriptive messages
No proprietary dependencies: Stick to open-source libraries and free tools
Success criteria:
Successful deployment: Book live on GitHub Pages with no broken links or build errors
Spec compliance: 100% of book content traceable to Spec-Kit Plus outputs
User feedback: Positive validation through at least one peer review or test reader
Performance: Site loads under 3 seconds, passes Lighthouse audit with score >90
