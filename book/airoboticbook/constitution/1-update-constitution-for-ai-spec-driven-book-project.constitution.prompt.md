## Prompt

   Project: AI/Spec-Driven Book Creation: Write a book using Docusaurus and deploy it to GitHub Pages, utilizing Spec-Kit Plus and Claude Code
Core principles:

Spec-driven development: All content and structure must adhere to predefined specifications generated via Spec-Kit Plus
AI-assisted efficiency: Leverage Claude Code for code generation and content drafting while ensuring human oversight for quality
Open-source accessibility: Use Docusaurus for static site generation to create a readable, navigable book format hosted on GitHub Pages
Iterative refinement: Build the book through incremental specs, reviews, and deployments
Key standards:
Content organization: Follow Docusaurus markdown structure with clear hierarchy (chapters, sections, sidebars)
Code quality: All generated code (via Claude Code) must be linted, tested, and version-controlled in Git
Documentation: Every spec from Spec-Kit Plus must be documented and traceable in the repository
Deployment: Automated CI/CD via GitHub Actions for GitHub Pages
Accessibility: Ensure book content meets WCAG 2.1 standards (e.g., alt text for images, semantic headings)
Constraints:
Tools: Exclusively use Spec-Kit Plus for spec generation, Claude Code for AI assistance, Docusaurus for site building, and GitHub for hosting
Book length: Minimum 10 chapters or equivalent sections, with at least 20,000 words
Version control: All changes committed to Git with descriptive messages
No proprietary dependencies: Stick to open-source libraries and free tools
Success criteria:
Successful deployment: Book live on GitHub Pages with no broken links or build errors
Spec compliance: 100% of book content traceable to Spec-Kit Plus outputs
User feedback: Positive validation through at least one peer review or test reader
Performance: Site loads under 3 seconds, passes Lighthouse audit with score >90

## Response snapshot

Updated project constitution to version 1.0.0.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Constitution established for the project.
- 🧪 Tests: N/A
- 📁 Files: .specify/memory/constitution.md modified.
- 🔁 Next prompts: Begin creating feature specifications.
- 🧠 Reflection: Successfully updated the constitution based on user input and project requirements.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: `create-phr.sh` script not found, fell back to agent-native tools.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Ensure `create-phr.sh` or similar script is available or documented for future PHR creation.
