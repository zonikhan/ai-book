Tasks: Book on Teaching Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics
Input: Design documents from /specs/1-robotics-book/ Prerequisites: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

Tests: The spec does not explicitly request generating test tasks, so only content creation and setup tasks are included.

Organization: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

Format: [ID] [P?] [Story] Description
[P]: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
[Story]: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
Include exact file paths in descriptions
Path Conventions
Project Structure: Docusaurus-based, as defined in specs/1-robotics-book/plan.md
All content paths will be relative to the docs/ directory for chapters and static/img/ for images.

Dependencies & Execution Order
Phase Dependencies
Setup (Phase 1): No dependencies - can start immediately
Foundational (Phase 2): Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories.
User Stories (Phase 3-7): All depend on Foundational phase completion.
User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed) or sequentially in priority order (P1 → P2 → P3).
Polish (Phase 8): Depends on all desired user stories content being complete.
User Story Dependencies
User Story 1 (P1): Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Foundational for subsequent modules.
User Story 2 (P1): Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Depends on US1 for ROS 2 fundamentals.
User Story 3 (P2): Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Depends on US1 and US2.
User Story 4 (P2): Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Depends on US1, US2, and US3.
User Story 5 (P1 - Capstone): Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Depends on US1, US2, US3, and US4.
Within Each User Story
Drafting foundational chapters before more advanced ones.
Adding examples and exercises as content is drafted.
Textual diagram placeholders should be added during drafting.
Parallel Opportunities
Tasks marked [P] within Phase 1 (Setup) can run in parallel.
Different chapters within the same module (if applicable and content is distinct enough) could be drafted in parallel.
Once foundational content for a module is laid out, the detailed drafting of individual chapters can potentially be parallelized.
Once all core module content is drafted, some tasks in the Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns phase (e.g., readability review, plagiarism check) can be initiated in parallel.
Parallel Example: Content Creation for Module 1 (US1)
# Draft chapters for Module 1 concurrently:
Task: "Draft docs/module1-ros2/chapter1.mdx covering ROS 2 introduction..."
Task: "Draft docs/module1-ros2/chapter2.mdx covering URDF, Launch files..."

# Add details to drafted chapters concurrently:
Task: "Add practical examples and short exercises for ROS 2 concepts within docs/module1-ros2/ chapters"
Task: "Add textual diagram descriptions to docs/module1-ros2/ chapters where needed"
Implementation Strategy
MVP First (Module 1 Only)
Complete Phase 1: Setup
Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all content creation)
Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (Module 1 content)
STOP and VALIDATE: Review Module 1 content for clarity, accuracy, and adherence to requirements. Build Docusaurus and verify Module 1 renders correctly.
Deploy/demo if ready (e.g., a preview of the first module).
Incremental Delivery
Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready.
Add User Story 1 (Module 1) → Review independently → Deploy/Demo (MVP!).
Add User Story 2 (Module 2) → Review independently → Deploy/Demo.
Continue for User Stories 3, 4, and 5 sequentially.
Each completed module adds value and integrates with previous modules.
Parallel Team Strategy
With multiple content creators/developers:

Team completes Setup + Foundational together.
Once Foundational is done:
Content Creator A: User Story 1 (Module 1)
Content Creator B: User Story 2 (Module 2)
Content Creator C: User Story 3 (Module 3)
Content Creator D: User Story 4 (Module 4)
Content Creator E: User Story 5 (Module 5)
Modules are drafted and reviewed; integration points (e.g., ROS 2 basics from M1 in M2) are coordinated.
Notes
[P] tasks = different files, no direct blocking dependencies
[Story] label maps task to specific user story/module for traceability
Each user story/module should be independently completable and testable (content-wise)
Commit after each task or logical group of tasks.
Stop at any checkpoint to validate content independently.
Avoid: vague tasks, cross-module dependencies that break independent review.
