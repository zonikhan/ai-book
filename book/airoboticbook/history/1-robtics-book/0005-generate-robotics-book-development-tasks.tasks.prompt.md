Prompt
       Create a technical plan for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics book, based on the previously defined /sp.specify. Include architecture, section structure, research approach, quality validation, and testing strategy.

Tasks for Plan Generation
1. Architecture Sketch

Diagram or textual description of the book’s structural flow:

Preface → Module 1 → Module 2 → Module 3 → Module 4 → Module 5 → Appendices

Map dependencies between modules (e.g., Module 1 foundational for Modules 2–5)

Include hardware/software requirements mapping to each module:

ROS 2 → Module 1

Gazebo/Unity → Module 2

NVIDIA Isaac → Module 3

VLA + Whisper → Module 4

Capstone → Module 5 + hardware edge kits

2. Section Structure

Break each module into chapters/sections with headings

Include meta-description, exercises, diagrams placeholders

Align structure with learning outcomes:

Module 1 → ROS 2 basics, nodes, URDF

Module 2 → Digital twin, simulation, sensors

Module 3 → AI perception, navigation, sim-to-real

Module 4 → Voice-command integration, VLA

Module 5 → Capstone, integration, deployment

Specify approximate word count per section for balancing total book size (5,000–7,500 words)

3. Research Approach

Use research-concurrent approach: gather sources while writing each module

Follow APA citation style from Constitution

Prioritize sources:

Peer-reviewed journals (>50%)

Official documentation (ROS 2, Gazebo, Unity, Isaac Sim, NVIDIA)

Tutorials/examples for hands-on exercises

Include references for:

Robotics fundamentals

Simulation best practices

AI perception and navigation

VLA integration

4. Decisions Needing Documentation

Hardoftware selection: Workstation specs, Edge Kit models, Robot Lab tiers (Proxy vs Miniature vs Premium)

Simulation environment: Gazebo vs Unity integration tradeoffs

VLA implementation: Whisper + GPT integration choices

Deployment method: Cloud vs On-premise lab

Document options, tradeoffs, cost, accessibility for each decision

5. Quality Validation

Align content with success criteria from /sp.specify

Include checkpoints per module:

Module 1 → ROS 2 nodes compile and run correctly

Module 2 → Simulated humanoid behaves as expected

Module 3 → Isaac perception and navigation pipelines validated

Module 4 → Voice-to-action commands execute reliably

Module 5 → Capstone task completed end-to-end

Ensure clarity, completeness, and APA-compliant citations

6. Testing Strategy

Validation checks:

Module exercises executed and tested (ROS 2 nodes, simulations, VLA commands)

Hardoftware integration works as expected

Capstone project functions on both simulation and Edge AI kit

Text content checked for plagiarism and clarity

Iterative review after each module: update plan and sections as needed

7. Technical Phases

Phase 1 – Research: Collect references and sources concurrently with module creation

Phase 2 – Foundation: Establish module frameworks, diagrams, and section headings

Phase 3 – Analysis: Map dependencies, validate exercises, review hardware/software alignment

Phase 4 – Synthesis: Combine modules, finalize capstone instructions, ensure book readiness for Docusaurus deployment"
