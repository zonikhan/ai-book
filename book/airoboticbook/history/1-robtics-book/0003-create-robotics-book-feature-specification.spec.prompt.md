Meta descriptions (≤30 words) included for each chapter

References authoritative sources (minimum 50% peer-reviewed or official docs)

Writing clarity: Flesch-Kincaid Grade 8–10

Total word count: 5,000–7,500 words

Format: Markdown (.mdx) compatible with Docusaurus

Zero plagiarism

Constraints

Sources: Peer-reviewed journals, textbooks, official documentation, tutorials

Timeline: Suitable for a 12–13 week course

Out of scope: Full AI literature review, ethical discussions, commercial product comparisons

Images: Provide textual description placeholders for diagrams to be generated later\n\nModule Specifications\nModule 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)\n\nMeta description:\nIntroduction to ROS 2, its architecture, and Python integration for controlling humanoid robots.\n\nHeadings / Subsections:\n\nIntroduction to ROS 2 and its architecture\n\nNodes, Topics, Services, and Actions\n\nPython integration using rclpy\n\nURDF: defining humanoid robots\n\nLaunch files and parameter management\n\nHands-on: creating a basic ROS 2 node network\n\nPractical example: controlling a humanoid joint\n\nExercises / Outputs:\n\nBuild a ROS 2 package for a humanoid robot\n\nPublish and subscribe to topic messages\n\nVisualize joint movement in RViz\n\nSuccess criteria:\n\nReader can create ROS 2 nodes and packages\n\nReader can simulate simple humanoid actions\n\nModule 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)\n\nMeta description:\nSimulate humanoid robots in virtual environments using Gazebo and Unity for physics, sensors, and rendering.\n\nHeadings / Subsections:\n\nIntroduction to simulation and the digital twin concept\n\nGazebo physics: collisions, gravity, and dynamics\n\nUnity rendering and human-robot interaction\n\nSensor simulation: LIDAR, Depth Cameras, IMUs\n\nSynchronizing simulation with ROS 2\n\nHands-on: building a humanoid simulation\n\nPractical exercise: navigating a virtual environment\n\nExercises / Outputs:\n\nCreate a Gazebo world with a humanoid robot\n\nSimulate sensors and visualize outputs\n\nIntegrate ROS 2 node data with Unity visualization\n\nSuccess criteria:\n\nReader can simulate humanoid motion and sensors in Gazebo\n\nReader can visualize robot behavior in Unity\n\nModule 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)\n\nMeta description:\nTrain humanoid robots for perception, navigation, and AI-driven behavior using NVIDIA Isaac Sim and Isaac ROS.\n\nHeadings / Subsections:\n\nIntroduction to NVIDIA Isaac Sim\n\nPhotorealistic simulation and synthetic data generation\n\nIsaac ROS: perception pipelines and VSLAM\n\nNav2 path planning for bipedal humanoids\n\nReinforcement learning basics for robot control\n\nSim-to-real transfer techniques\n\nHands-on: perception and navigation pipeline\n\nExercises / Outputs:\n\nTrain perception models in Isaac Sim\n\nImplement VSLAM-based navigation\n\nTest sim-to-real deployment on edge kit\n\nSuccess criteria:\n\nReader can implement AI perception and path planning\n\nReader understands sim-to-real deployment challenges\n\nModule 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Integration\n\nMeta description:\nIntegrate language models and speech recognition with humanoid robots for autonomous voice-command execution.\n\nHeadings / Subsections:\n\nIntroduction to VLA in robotics\n\nOpenAI Whisper: voice-to-action commands\n\nCognitive planning: translating language to ROS 2 actions\n\nMulti-modal interaction: speech, gesture, and vision\n\nIntegration with NVIDIA Isaac and ROS 2\n\nHands-on: simple voice-command humanoid robot\n\nCapstone project preparation\n\nExercises / Outputs:\n\nImplement a voice-command pipeline for a humanoid\n\nConvert natural language commands into robot actions\n\nTest multi-modal robot response\n\nSuccess criteria:\n\nReader can control a robot via speech commands\n\nReader can plan sequences of robot actions from natural language\n\nModule 5: Capstone Project – Autonomous Humanoid\n\nMeta description:\nDesign and deploy a fully autonomous humanoid robot performing navigation, perception, and object manipulation tasks.\n\nHeadings / Subsections:\n\nCapstone overview and objectives\n\nHardoftware and software integration: workstation, Jetson, sensors, actuators\n\nAutonomous navigation planning\n\nObject identification and manipulation\n\nMulti-modal interaction (speech, vision, gesture)\n\nSim-to-real deployment on edge kit\n\nAssessment and success criteria\n\nExercises / Outputs:\n\nSimulate full humanoid task in Isaac/Gazebo\n\nDeploy trained perception and control stack to Jetson kit\n\nPerform end-to-end autonomous task execution\n\nSuccess criteria:\n\nReader can complete autonomous humanoid task\n\nReader can integrate ROS 2, Isaac, VLA pipeline in simulation and real-world\n\nAppendices / Resources\n\nHardoftware setup guides: workstation, edge kits, sensor integration\n\nSoftware installation guides: ROS 2, Gazebo, Unity, Isaac Sim\n\nGlossary of key terms and acronyms\n\nReferences: papers, tutorials, official docs"
Response snapshot
The feature specification for "Book on Teaching Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" has been created at specs/1-robotics-book/spec.md. A quality checklist for this specification has also been generated at specs/1-robotics-book/checklists/requirements.md. The feature branch 1-robotics-book is ready.

Outcome
✅ Impact: Feature specification created and branch initiated.
🧪 Tests: No explicit tests were run for spec creation.
📁 Files: specs/1-robotics-book/spec.md and specs/1-robotics-book/checklists/requirements.md created. Branch 1-robotics-book checked out.
🔁 Next prompts: User to review spec and proceed to planning (/sp.plan) or clarification (/sp.clarify).
🧠 Reflection: Successfully created a detailed spec and checklist based on user input, handling the pwsh script execution failure by manually performing git and file operations.
Evaluation notes (flywheel)
Failure modes observed: pwsh script execution failed due to environment issues. Handled gracefully by manual tool calls.
Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
